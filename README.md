# Strava_Clustering

What was I trying to do?Â¶
Practice clustering on a real world dataset.
See if there were insights that would improve my cycling hobby.

What did I learn from creating this analysis?
Preprocessing your data takes a lot longer than creating the model
Understanding the dataset is essential. I originally created the model with an assumption that the start time was in my time zone. It wasn't until I started to look at the data that I realized they transform all start times to UTC. So I was 5 hours off!
Understanding the data allowed creation of an additional derived data set

So what do I conclude from this clustering analysis?
I ride a lot in the morning and after work betwen 5-10 miles
I do long rides more often early in the day vs late in the day
I need to do more long rides :)
